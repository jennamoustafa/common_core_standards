# This is the final project for Harvard's Gov1005 course, Data. The project explores the impact of the Common Core Standards on racial achievement gaps in the K-12 system, specifically examining National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores at the fourth and eighth grade level in reading and mathematics. Results of the study generally suggest that educational achievement gaps regarding race are still ever present. Though the Common Core Standards are generally associated with higher test scores, both for students overall and, to a lesser degree, racial minority students, the association between the program and test scores lack the statistical significance to regard this relationship with certainty. Thus, other programs that provide financial support to minority students, are likelier to be a more helpful aid for narrowing the achievement gap than the Common Core Standards.
